# Excited to announce the completion of my latest project: Restaurant Predictive Modelling! üéâüçΩÔ∏è

# In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a global restaurant dataset to uncover insights into dining trends and preferences across different cities and cuisines. Our analysis focused on several key aspects:

Geographical Analysis: We explored the distribution of restaurants across various cities and examined how location influences dining preferences and restaurant offerings.
Cuisine Popularity: We analyzed the variety of cuisines offered and identified the most popular cuisines in different regions.
Cost Analysis: We investigated the average cost of dining out, providing a comparative analysis of dining expenses across different cities.
Customer Ratings and Reviews: We delved into customer feedback, analyzing ratings and reviews to gauge customer satisfaction and identify top-rated restaurants.
Service Analysis: We assessed the availability of services like table booking and online delivery, and their impact on customer choice and satisfaction.

3 This project not only provided valuable insights into the current state of the global dining scene but also highlighted potential opportunities for restaurant owners to enhance their services and offerings. The findings from this analysis can help stakeholders make informed decisions to improve customer experience and operational efficiency.# Restaurant-Predictive-Modelling
